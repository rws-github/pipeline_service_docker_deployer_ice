# The following environment variables will be set: 
# IMAGE_NAME: The name of the image used as input 
# IP_LIMIT: The max allowed public IP addresses for this space 
# CONTAINER_NAME: The name parameter exposed on this job
# DEPLOY_TYPE: Input into the deployment strategy desired.  For example: simple, red_black
